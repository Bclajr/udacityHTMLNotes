    <h2>World Wide Web</h2>
    <p>The web is constructed of 4 different components:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>The Browser is a computer application that connects to the internet. There are multiple types of browsers that can be chosen from.</li>
        <li>The internet is network of computers connected to each other that passes information to each other.</li>
        <li>HTTP stands for <em>Hyper Text Transfer Protocol</em> and it is the protocol that the browser communicates to the servers with.</li>
        <li>Servers are computers that are designed to store information which websites are built upon.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>HTML</h2>
    <p>HTML stands for <em>Hypertext Markup Language</em>. It is the skeleton of most web pages and other languages structure themselves around it.</p>
    <p>HTML is made up 4 things:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Text content: It is what you see.</li>
        <li>Markup: It is what the the content looks like</li>
        <li>References to other documents: Like images and videos</li>
        <li>Links to other pages: Which is anchors tags or hyperlinks that sends you somewhere else</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Style Elements</h2>
    <p>There are certain tag <strong>elements</strong> that can <strong>style</strong> the text.</p>
    <p>You can make any text bold with using the strong tag. This <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irJ9o1Uv6U8">Video</a> will show how it works</p>
    <p>Another example is, you can make any text italic with em tag. This <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H23hC78J_A">Video</a> will show how to implement it in the HTML</p>
    <h2>Inline vs Block Elements</h2>
    <p><strong>Inline elements</strong> only separate itself from other elements from top to bottom. Whereas, <strong>block element</strong> separate itself from other elements with an invisible box. this

    <h2>Anchor Tags and Images</h2>
    <p><strong>Anchor tags</strong> make it where any text can be made a link to any web page and other miscellaneous places by using the word href and enclosing the link in parentheses and then brackets.</p>
    <p><strong>Images</strong> are similar since you have to provide a link but, you have to use the word src instead of href. Also, you do not have to encapsulate any word with images. 
    Technically the image will work without the attribute alt, it is standard practice to use it which describes what the image displays. This attribute is used for seeing impaired

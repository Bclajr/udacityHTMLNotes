    <h2>World Wide Web</h2>
    <p>The web is constructed of 4 different components:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>The Browser is a computer application that connects to the internet. There are multiple types of browsers that can be chosen from.</li>
        <li>The internet is network of computers connected to each other that passes information to each other.</li>
        <li>HTTP stands for <em>Hyper Text Transfer Protocol</em> and it is the protocol that the browser communicates to the servers with.</li>
        <li>Servers are computers that are designed to store information which websites are built upon.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>HTML</h2>
    <p>HTML stands for <em>Hypertext Markup Language</em>. It is the skeleton of most web pages and other languages structure themselves around it.</p>
    <p>HTML is made up 4 things:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Text content: It is what you see.</li>
        <li>Markup: It is what the the content looks like</li>
        <li>References to other documents: Like images and videos</li>
        <li>Links to other pages: Which is anchors tags or hyperlinks that sends you somewhere else</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Style Elements</h2>
    <p>There are certain tag elements that can style the text.</p>
    <p>You can make any text bold with using the strong tag. This <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irJ9o1Uv6U8" alt="Uacity video 'Bold Tag'">Video</a> will show how it works</p>
